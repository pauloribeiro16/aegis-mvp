## DORA
#### 4.27 CL21-1 — Art. 21(1)+(2) — Single EU Hub feasibility mandate
**Source locus:** Art. 21(1) and 21(2).
> 1. The ESAs, through the Joint Committee, and in consultation with the ECB and ENISA, shall prepare a joint report assessing the **feasibility of further centralisation of incident reporting through the establishment of a single EU Hub for major ICT-related incident reporting** by financial entities. The joint report shall explore ways to facilitate the flow of ICT-related incident reporting, reduce associated costs and underpin thematic analyses with a view to enhancing supervisory convergence.
>
> 2. The joint report referred to in paragraph 1 shall comprise at least the following elements:
>
> (a) prerequisites for the establishment of a single EU Hub;
>
> (b) benefits, limitations and risks, including risks associated with the high concentration of sensitive information;
>
> (c) the necessary capability to ensure interoperability with regard to other relevant reporting schemes;
>
> (d) elements of operational management;
>
> (e) conditions of membership;
>
> (f) technical arrangements for financial entities and national competent authorities to access the single EU Hub;
>
> (g) a preliminary assessment of financial costs incurred by setting-up the operational platform supporting the single EU Hub, including the requisite expertise.
**Instance 1 — VAG — S3 — `single EU Hub`**
`single` + `Hub` — the architectural choice is undefined.
- **R1:** Single centralised data platform (one location, all CAs access).
- **R2:** Single API gateway (each CA holds data, common API).
- **R3:** Single standard (distributed but interoperable).
| # | Reading | Disambiguation source |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | Centralised platform | In-Directive: literal `single EU Hub` |
| R2 | API gateway | None in OJ |
| R3 | Single standard | None in OJ |
S3.
*Berry anchor:* §3.3.1 (`single`, `Hub`); §5.1 (`single`).
**Instance 2 — VAG — S3 — `feasibility`**
`feasibility` of centralisation is broad — technical + legal + operational + financial + governance. S3.
*Berry anchor:* §5.1 (`feasibility`).
**Instance 3 — VAG — S3 — `thematic analyses with a view to enhancing supervisory convergence`**
`thematic analyses` + `supervisory convergence` — undefined. S3.
*Berry anchor:* §3.3.1 (`thematic analyses`, `supervisory convergence`).
**Instance 4 — VAG — S2 — `high concentration of sensitive information`**
`high concentration` is undefined. Same Berry pattern as DORA-D29 `ICT concentration risk`. S2.
*Berry anchor:* §5.1 (`high concentration`); cf. DORA-D29.
**Instance 5 — POLY — S2 — 7 enumerated elements**
Each element admits its own internal ambiguity:
| Element | Key ambiguity | Berry anchor |
|---|---|---|
| (a) `prerequisites` | Hard vs. soft preconditions | §3.3.1 (`prerequisites`) |
| (b) `benefits, limitations and risks` | Three-way comparison standard | §5.4.7 (three-way) |
| (c) `interoperability` | Technical vs. semantic | §3.3.1 (`interoperability`) |
| (d) `operational management` | Undefined scope | §3.3.1 (`operational management`) |
| (e) `conditions of membership` | Who becomes a member? | §3.3.1 (`membership`) |
| (f) `technical arrangements` | Read-only vs. write access | §3.3.1 (`technical arrangements`) |
| (g) `preliminary assessment of financial costs` | Method-based vs. estimate-based | §3.3.1 (`preliminary`) |
S2 (per-element); aggregate S3 due to the open-ended `at least` qualifier.
*Berry anchor:* §5.4.5 (illustrative use — `at least`); §3.3.1.
**Definitional anchor:** DORA-D29 `ICT concentration risk`; DORA Art. 50 (administrative penalties context).
**Scope:** regulator-internal (between ESAs and NCA institutional architecture, not directly entity-facing).
**Proportionality-status:** Art. 4 applies.
